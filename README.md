# Push4mixxx

A work-in-progress-but-mostly-usable-and-tested-at-weddings controller mapping for the Ableton Push 1 for [Mixxx](https://mixxx.org/).

Adapted from [this draft](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/11101) by [Replayman](https://github.com/Replayman) and then converted to be more into the direction of the [Trash mapping for Traktor](http://www.flosaic.com/trash/) by David Schroeter. All credits go to them. All mistakes are mine.

Run `bash install.sh` to link the files into `$HOME/.mixxx/controllers/`.

Have fun!
